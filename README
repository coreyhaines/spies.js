== spies.js

This is a javascript spy framework that was extracted from work on The Stickies Project (http://thestickiesproject.heroku.com). 
You can read about our work on The Stickies Project on the our blog, where we post about interesting things we've found while working: http://thestickiesproject.wordpress.com/

I'll be writing a blog post soon, but you can see usage via the example specs.

The tests are using jasmine, specifically the jasmine-ruby gem.
