== spies.js

This is a javascript spy framework that was extracted from work on The Stickies Project (http://thestickiesproject.heroku.com). 

I'll be writing a blog post soon, but you can see usage via the example specs.

The tests are using jasmine, specifically the jasmine-ruby gem.

== Using spies.js

1. Put spies.js in an accessible place in your application.
2. Include it in your specs
3. Use it according to the examples (located in spec/javascript/spies_spec.js)
